## Background
This is a project that I created in Feb 2021.
The main purpose of this project was to test my ability to read through documentation and 
use my working knowledge to setup a web server using node, fetch data using the server and ultimately be able to leverage someone else's code to create my own project.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* CSS3
* HTML5
* Node.js
* Javascript

	
## Setup
To run this project, download the files and then run the following commands in your terminal (you will need npm, node, and Express installed):

Command | Description
-------------|--------------------------------
$ cd ../new| Navigate to the new directory which will likely be located in your downloads folder.
$ npm install |Use this command to install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.
$ node server.js |Use this command to kick-off the server so that you can paste it in your browser to run locally.


After running all of the commands above visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ - the site should be deployed and visible on TCP port 8000 of your local machine.
